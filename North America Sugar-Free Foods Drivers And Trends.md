Increasing awareness about the negative health effects of sugar, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, is motivating consumers to seek out sugar-free alternatives. Furthermore, the rise in health-conscious individuals, particularly among millennials and Generation Z, has prompted food manufacturers to innovate with sugar-free products that cater to low-calorie, diabetic, and keto diets. The increasing availability of sugar substitutes, such as stevia, monk fruit, and erythritol, has also contributed to the growth of this market segment.</p><p>Additionally, the trend toward clean label products and natural ingredients is influencing the expansion of the sugar-free food market in North America.
